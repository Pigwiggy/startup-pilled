# Introduction to Slurdle

## Overview

I came up with this idea when I was trying to recreate a basic version of Wordle (see other file).  
It's basically the same as Wordle but instead the word bank is just slurs.  
There will be easy and hard modes where the easy mode tells you how many letters the slur has.  


## Disclaimer

I do not endorse slurs, this is simply a fun challenge I created for myself because I thought the name was creative.  
The word bank in Slurdle does not reflect any personal views, politics, or opinions.
